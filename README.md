# HackYourWorld

## About the Project

HackYourWorld is a simple website designed to fetch and display information about countries around the world. The data is sourced from an external API, providing users with up-to-date and accurate details. This project is lightweight, user-friendly, and aims to help users explore global data effortlessly.

This project is a work-in-progress and follows the MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have) prioritization method to outline its core functionality and goals.

## Features

### Must Have

These features are critical to the success of the project and will be implemented in the initial phase:

- Fetch and display basic country data (name, capital, population, region, etc.) from the external API.
- A clean and responsive UI for browsing the list of countries.
- Search functionality to find a country by name.
- Error handling for failed API requests or connectivity issues.

### Should Have

These features are important but not critical and will be addressed after the "Must Have" features:

- Filter countries by region or population size.
- Pagination or infinite scroll for browsing large lists of countries.
- A detailed view for each country with additional information such as languages, currencies, and neighboring countries.

### Could Have

These features are nice-to-have and may be implemented if time and resources permit:

- A dark mode for better user experience in low-light environments.
- Save favorite countries to local storage or user account.
- Interactive maps to visually explore countries and their borders.
